Pluto (minor planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond Neptune. It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered.

Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun.

After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt.

In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered
